# Welcome to my portfolio page!
I will be working on this application over time. This is only going to be a frontend application.
Heroku will be moving away from free hosting in November so I decided to host this on Github Pages.
This will mainly be a react application.

# Goals:
- Create a front-end application to showcase front-end skills that I have.
- Be comfortable writing tests using Jest and the React Testing Library.

# To Run:
npm start
